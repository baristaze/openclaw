# High-Quality Discovery (Twitter/X)

Goal: find high-signal conversations and topics worth engaging **today**, while staying aligned with the user’s interests + style and keeping volume intentionally low.

Discovery surfaces: per config-template.md (default: Home Following + Explore Trending).

Use this document to evaluate what to engage, what to ignore, and when to stop.

## 1) What “high-quality discovery” means (practical definition)

A discovery session is “high-quality” when it yields a small shortlist of targets that are:
- **Relevant** to the interests whitelist and not in the blacklist
- **Timely** (fresh enough that engagement can be seen and welcomed)
- **High-signal** (substantive, specific, or uniquely insightful—not generic)
- **On-brand** for the persona (smart/witty/playful/cheeky/impish, never toxic)
- **Actionable** (a reply/quote/original idea can be drafted that adds value)

Because posting is low-volume, discovery quality matters more than “finding anything.”

## 2) Signals to look for (positive indicators)

### A) Fresh threads with momentum (but not chaos)
Look for:
- Thread posted recently (generally within the last few hours) with **active replies**
- The conversation has **room for a clever/insightful addition**
- The author is still engaging or the replies show ongoing discussion
- The topic is aligned with whitelist interests (or adjacent, with clear relevance)

Prefer threads where:
- Your reply can add a *specific* point, example, or reframing
- There’s a clear prompt/question to respond to
- You can be concise and still valuable

### B) High-signal experts and builders
Look for accounts that:
- Share concrete lessons learned, data, or real implementation detail
- Make falsifiable claims or provide examples (not vague hype)
- Are consistently thoughtful and avoid drama farming
- Sit at the center of your interest graph (your whitelist)

Strong indicators:
- “Here’s what we tried → what happened → what we changed”
- Short, opinionated takes with clear reasoning
- Useful mini-frameworks, checklists, or diagrams (even described in text)

### C) Emerging topics with a clean angle
Look for “new but not messy”:
- A fresh announcement + immediate thoughtful reactions
- A new paper/product release + early technical commentary
- A developing story where you can add a *calm, specific* take (not moralizing)

Good “emerging” topics are ones where:
- You can summarize, clarify, or point to a useful resource
- You can provide a succinct “why it matters” without overclaiming
- You can connect it to your persona’s niche

### D) High-quality prompts for original tweets
Discovery isn’t only about replying. It can feed originals when you see:
- Repeated questions people are asking (pattern recognition)
- Confusion/misconceptions you can clarify quickly
- A strong “hot take” opportunity that’s playful, not inflammatory
- A simple observation that’s timely and broadly relatable *within the niche*

---

## 3) Signals to avoid (negative indicators)

### A) Ragebait / outrage loops
Avoid content designed to trigger tribal reactions:
- “Everyone who does X is an idiot” framing
- Excessive dunking, pile-ons, humiliation
- Culture-war framing, moral grandstanding
- Threads dominated by insults/snark without substance

If the user blacklist includes sensitive topics, treat this as a hard stop.

### B) Low-context meme churn
Avoid:
- Posts that require deep inside-jokes/context you don’t have
- Meme formats where the “correct” reply is purely performative
- Viral jokes where adding a reply increases risk of being cringe/off-tone

### C) Sensitive or ambiguous topics (when in doubt, skip)
Skip or downgrade when:
- The topic touches politics, religion, health, personal tragedy, legal accusations, or private individuals
- The thread includes unverified claims, rumors, or “breaking” allegations
- The tone is emotionally volatile or dogpiley

If you’re unsure and it’s not clearly safe/on-whitelist, do not engage.

### D) Engagement traps / bait metrics
Avoid:
- “Like if you agree / RT if you…” posts
- Giveaways or follow-gating (also disallowed by no follow/unfollow)
- Clickbait summaries with no substance

## 4) Quick scoring rubric (to rank candidates)

Score each candidate 1–5 (fast heuristic):
- **Relevance** (fits whitelist, not blacklist)
- **Recency** (not stale; conversation still alive)
- **Signal** (substantive, specific, learnable)
- **Persona fit** (can respond in style without forcing it)
- **Low risk** (not sensitive, not drama, not ambiguous)

Prefer candidates that are strong across all five, even if smaller accounts.

---

## 5) Candidate types to collect during discovery

When saving a candidate, capture:
- URL
- Author handle + brief why they matter (expertise / audience fit)
- Tweet context (what are they saying? what's the angle?)
- Language (per config)
- Proposed action type: reply / quote / original
- 1-sentence "value add" you'd contribute
- Risk notes (if any)
- "Engaged already?" marker (must be false)

Shortlist size: per defaults in `SKILL.md`.

---

## 6) Stopping rules

- Browse each configured surface with 1-2 scrolls.
- Shortlist as soon as good candidates are found.
- Do not scroll indefinitely.
- If quality is low after covering all configured surfaces, report to user.

---

## 7) Surface-specific tips (lightweight)

Home → Following:
- Best for staying consistent with accounts the user already cares about.
- Often higher signal, lower chaos.

Home → For You:
- Best for discovering adjacent topics and new voices.
- Higher variance; be stricter with the scoring rubric.

Explore → Trending / News:
- Treat as “idea source,” not a requirement to engage.
- Higher risk of sensitive/fast-moving stories; avoid if blacklist overlaps.

Explore → For You:
- Useful for niche clustering; find repeated themes and questions.

---

## 8) If discovery quality is low

If you can't find enough strong candidates:
- Do not post just to post.
- Report back briefly:
  - “Discovery quality low today; here’s what I saw”
  - Ask if the user wants to adjust whitelist/blacklist or allow a different content type (e.g., original tweet instead of replies).
